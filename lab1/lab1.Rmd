# Simple Addition
7+11
7-11
7 - 11

# Example of Multiplication and Division
7*11
7/11
7 / 11

# More examples
9 / (1+3)
9 / 1 + 3
5*2     +    3
8 %% 3
8 %/% 3

12^2 # integer square

# Multiple codes on one line:

7/3 ; 7*3

# Assignment Operations: Equal Sign and Arrow in R
a1 = 7
b1 = 11

a2 <- 7
11 -> b2

mean(x <- c(1,8,4,9,13))
x
# x = is used in a function, however if we did this we could not
# have the 9th line calling x as nothing would be assigned to it

mean(y <- c(1,8,4,9,13))
y

# In the first case x is an argument for a function (caused an error in my case); while the second case assigns a vector to x then finds the mean value of it

# Examples defining R objects
x <- 4
y = 5
x+y
z<-x+2*y

# compute the value of an object
x <- 6
x
z < -9
a = x^2

# Parentheses, Brackets & Curly Brackets

# Parentheses, (), are used to call functions. Brackets, [] are used to obtain values in a data structure, Curly Brackets, {} are used to denote a block of code within in a conditional statement

# Here, we give examples about the use of () and []. THe use of curly brackets will be introduced later.

w <- c(17, 57, 69, 50, 100, 68, 29, 16, 65, 5, 15, 25) # c() combines objects into a set
median(w) # finds the median of the set
w[3] # finds the value of the third element in w
w[1:2] # finds the values of the first and second elements
w[2:4] # finds the values between the second and fourth element
w[c(2,5,8)] # only find the values of the second, fifth and eigth elements in w
w[-5] # the fifth element is removed
w[w < 50] # obtain values satisfying the condition
